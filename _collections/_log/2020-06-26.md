### C-PAC User support

#### C-PAC on Habanero

- Checkout testing config from previous Habanero tests and apply to new testing branch for [#1306](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1306). [Built that branch on CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/shnizzedy/C-PAC/79/workflows/17906421-c7bb-4203-ac23-e1d1dafb9c46).

- Hit this error:

```Python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/miniconda/lib/python3.7/multiprocessing/process.py", line 297, in _bootstrap
    self.run()

TypeError: sequence item 4: expected str instance, int found
```

- I caused that bug with a linting commit yesterday. Fixed it by casting `str(num_strat)`.
- Review [logs from Lisa](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1YX8onynFJRXR3ap3X429njCzlFRic-sr).

Try out [this](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/compare/04e55ccd7b050f5aaf56d762985ef612c2cbcd08...bugfix/1306/spike-censor-not-found#diff-cd3894bd987af2c380c8aab51376f0b9R281-R282):

```Python
# All good to pass through if nothing to censor
censor_volumes = np.ones((regressor_length,), dtype=int)
```

Started [this](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/compare/04e55ccd7b050f5aaf56d762985ef612c2cbcd08...bugfix/1306/spike-censor-not-found#diff-cd3894bd987af2c380c8aab51376f0b9R267-R280)
```Python
# â†“ This section is gross and temporary â†“
num_thresh = len(selector['Censor']['thresholds'])
plural_s = '' if num_thresh == 1 else 's'
thresh_list = [
    thresh['value'] for thresh in selector['Censor']['thresholds']
]
max_v = str([])
print(f"{selector['Censor']['method']} Censor "
      "specified with "
      f"{'no ' if num_thresh == 0 else ''}threshold"
      f"{plural_s} {str(thresh_list)} in selectors but "
      f" threshold was not reached. Max value{plural_s}"
      " in array: {max_v}")
# â†‘ This section is gross and temporary â†‘
```
, but not sure how best to access the arrays.

For context, Lisa told me she got [this crash](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1306) with a value of `7.436882164605260748e-01` in the respective `.1D` file (which is greater than the configured `0.5`). I'd like to be able to be more confident that we've correctly diagnosed/treated this bug.

My thought was to just load in the threshold and max value of the array, but in starting to code that up, I realized that the threshold + method is a list of dictionaries, so logging that message is less trivial than I anticipated.

---

From 

```Python
selector = selector['Censor']
regressor_file = censor_file_path
if not regressor_file:
    # â†“ This section is gross and temporary â†“
    num_thresh = len(selector['Censor']['thresholds'])
```

I discovered

```Python
File "/code/CPAC/nuisance/nuisance.py", line 269, in gather_nuisance
  num_thresh = len(selector['Censor']['thresholds'])

KeyError: 'Censor'
```

so I'm going to clear out that gross and temporary error message and see if that build will successfully get to the end of all 20 test subjects in our testing data configuration file.

If those tests all succeed, I want to run some sanity checks to make sure that success doesn't mean silent failure, and then we may have an image that's bug-free for your resting-state pipeline.

### C-PAC Documentation

<table class="conversation">
  <tr><td>Steve</td><td markdown="1">
  I'd like to start diving back into the SSOT and user docs refactoring next week, in conjunction with docs for the latest iteration of cpac-py- at some point between now and end of Monday, could you give us a quick rundown of where we left off on that?
  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>Jon</td><td markdown="1">
  For SSOT / docs, I've been working on restructuring the repo to
  <ol class="lower-alpha">
  <li>build the user and developer docs at once instead of separately</li>
  <li>start building versioned docs</li>
  </ol>
  but I've been prioritizing helping Nim's team, so this has been a while-things-are-running level task. I've got [a branch](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/fcp-indi.github.com/tree/config/versioned-docs) and [project board](https://github.com/shnizzedy/fcp-indi.github.com/projects/1) going, and it's the branch that my fork is building from at the moment.

### C-PAC Python Package

<table class="conversation">
  <tr><td>Jon</td><td markdown="1">
  I have [a draft PR in progress for docs for the Python package](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/fcp-indi.github.com/pull/219), though I seem to have [recently broken something in the `--image docker` option](https://github.com/shnizzedy/cpac-python-package/issues/34#issuecomment-648400818).
