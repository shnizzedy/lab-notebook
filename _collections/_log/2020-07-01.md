### C-PAC on Habanero
<table class="conversation"><tr><td>Jon</td><td markdown="1">
What command are you running to get the traceback in this email? It looks like `cpac-py` canâ€™t find `singularity` in your path. Does `which singularity` find it?
</td></tr><tr><td>Lisa</td><td markdown="1">
hm, no it does not... yet, I've had the cpac jobs run using the singularity images cited in the shell files, with different output. I'm really not sure how all this works!
</td></tr><tr><td>Jon</td><td markdown="1">
Has the previous image worked for any of your data?
</td></tr><tr><td>Lisa</td><td markdown="1">
as for the previous image - no not really- but I only tested 2 subjects, the first of which you had thought would be ok if the movement threshold was above 0.5, and we discovered that it had one 0.7, and that it doesn't work even when the threshold is lowered to 0.3. As well, when tested on a kid who was indicated to have had more motion, there were even fewer outputs.

I will try this afternoon's image tonight and hopefully have some results by tomorrow for you.
</td></tr><tr><td>Lisa</td><td markdown="1">
I ran some things on habanero/singularity yesterday using Jon's last image:
1. The less motion-y PACCT kid only returned the sinker errors so that's great!
2. I ran the same on a test SB, and got many out puts, with slighty different errors than above, which is also great!
3. however, the more motion-y PACCT kid, using the same image, still returned with many fewer outputs- I can drop the crash files into the drive for you Jon

### C-PAC testing
- Made a flowchart in Dia
- Remembered we have a Lucidchart subscription; transferred flowchart

### C-PAC

<table class="conversation"><tr><td>Steve</td><td markdown="1">
I'd like to shoot for Friday July 10th for 1.7 release- which means code locked by preferably Tuesday or Wednesday next week

[â€¦]

I would like it if we could try out some of each other's additions to start sanity checking:
* running CPAC via cpac-py
* running the longitudinal pipelines with some appropriate data
* running the ANTS prior-based segmentation
</td></tr><tr><td>Jon</td><td markdown="1">
For cpac-py, I think it's only working for Singularity at the moment. I'm not sure what the bug is with Docker, but it's recent and should be small. I can prioritize fixing it.

For a longitudinal run, do you have data in mind, or do we need to find some?

For ANTS priors, same question, plus human / NHP / rat?

re longitudinal dataset: [http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/CoRR/html/ibatrt.html](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/CoRR/html/ibatrt.html)
</td></tr><tr><td>Hecheng</td><td markdown="1">
I believe ants-prior segmentation is mainly for NHP. kick off 3 subjects oxford site data. `/data3/cnl/monkey_benchmark/cpac_run/run_bash/run_monkey_ants_priors_seg_0701.sh`
