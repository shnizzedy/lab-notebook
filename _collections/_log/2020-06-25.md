The not unexpected crash has occurred, but in an unexpected way.

My current step in debugging this issue is to update the crash message to output the threshold and max value of the one-dimensional array. I've started [a branch](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/tree/bugfix/1306/spike-censor-not-found) for working on this issue.

### C-PAC on Habanero

On Tuesday I met with Lisa to discuss a strategy for her team to move forward with C-PAC. I believe the Singularity-specific issues have been resolved, and I warned her that [FCP-INDI/C-PAC#1306: ðŸ’¬ Crash if nothing reaches a selected censor threshold](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1306) is an issue that I'm still hitting with some participants using [![YAML](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/69535?v=4&s=20) `rest_â€‹test_â€‹CPACv1.â€‹6.â€‹2_â€‹nuis1-3a-lower-thresh.â€‹yml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shnizzedy/blob/095990b0d82c54895e8fc0993168dee637bc89e3/dev/circleci_data/rest_test_CPACv1.6.2_nuis1-3a-lower-thresh.yml) (in both Singularity and Docker), but otherwise the image was running to completion on both that pipeline configuration and the default.

Today Lisa let me know that the crash happened but with a value of `7.436882164605260748e-01` (which is greater than `0.5`) in `FD.1D`.

Today I also started [a branch](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/tree/bugfix/1260/same-file-error) to resolve [FCP-INDI/C-PAC#1260: 'SameFileError' - crash file](https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues/1260).

<tr><td>Jon</td><td markdown="1">It seems censor_file_path isn't consistently being passed through to `gather_nuisance` when that function needs that parameter. When it needs it and doesn't have it, but I haven't nailed down yet whether the file is being generated and just not passed, or if it's not being generated. [This](https://github.com/shnizzedy/C-PAC/issues/2#issuecomment-644184195) is what selector looks like when the error occurs.
So if you have some inclination as to the reason of this behavior, I'll look into whatever you suggest. Otherwise, I'll just keep digging.
Re: Nim's email this afternoon, I've only been testing in Singularity since that's where they've been having trouble. I probably should also test in Docker. I'll kick one off now and respond to Nim's email once I see if it hits the same error in Docker.

<tr><td>Steve</td><td markdown="1">in that one specific example- if you can find `FD_P.1D` (if it exists) under `framewise_power` etc., are there any values above the `0.5` threshold in that `1D` file?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Jon</td><td markdown="1">Nope. The max of that file is `0.486589`. So that's probably the inconsistency â€” some files have at least one value that reaches the threshold; some don't.
So to run successfully, it should just take reducing the threshold, right?

<tr><td>Steve</td><td markdown="1">
that should get it to run, yeah! as for a solution, I wonder if we should just write out a blank censors file and pass that in, if `3dTproject` treats that as "don't regress that"<br/>
I'm going to try that out by hand

### C-PAC Documentation

I tried to trigger a rebuild to pull in the release notes from today's hotfix and discovered I no longer have enough permissions to triger builds for this repository on CircleCI nor to write to the repository on GitHub.

```BASH
ERROR: Permission to FCP-INDI/fcp-indi.github.com.git denied to shnizzedy.
```

Steve saved the day and restored my permissions on GitHub.

I also started looking into setting up [a GitHub Action to trigger a docs build](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-trigger-circleci-job) any time a new release isâ€¦ released.
