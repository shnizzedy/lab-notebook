> 1. [â€¦] i ran CPAC:FX on 1.7.2. I ran 10 test subjects at a range of motion estimates (from very low motion to very high motion).
> 7/10 had  outputs but 2 didn't get all the way through (so 5 did!), and it looks like 3 of the very high motion subjects don't have any output folders at all. [â€¦]
> 2. in addition, for all subjects who did get the full output on their first session, they did not have any output for their second session despite having very lot motion estimates as well. do i need to turn on the longitudinal setting for this to work?
> 3. i'm also not entirely sure what files would be helpful for you in helping me resolve the subjects who didn't finish complete, but let me know!

> I'm glad you're seeing some success. We'll do our best to help you get your pipeline working for everything else you want it to do. I'll probably ask for some more files as I dig in, but to start, can you please share your pipeline configuration and data configuration (if any, or let me know if you're just giving a BIDS directory)

> i'm also happy to be seeing some success! we are feeding in a BIDS directory - most participants have at least 2 sessions and multiple scan runs that we are processing for each session.
here is the config file i am using . running on 1 core. only things changed from original that Lei sent was some of the beginning information, turning on despiking, and specifying to extract an ROI time series for 2 atlases.

> it seems that many of the files are timeouts, so I will just relaunch those particular jobs. but there are some files that did not finish otherwise.
