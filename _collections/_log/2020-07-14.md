### C-PAC v1.7.0
<table class="conversation"><tr><td>Steve</td><td markdown="1">
Hi team- okay so v1.7, am I right? <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/emoji/steve-sunglasses.png" alt=":steve-sunglasses:" style="height:1em;">

Once the longitudinal PR is merged in, and I think the libGSL ones ([@Jon](https://cmi-cnl.slack.com/team/UC8MW4M9T) these can be merged into develop despite the 1291 hotfix right? I think I already asked earlier, sorry for repeat), I would say we can take this route:
- the longitudinal testing Xinhui lined up
- running regtest-1/2/3, fmriprep-options, default pipeline, NHP and rodent pipelines on Docker containers
While those run:
- Docs (what is left? we can split up)
- GUI additions (same as above)

Let's discuss further tomorrow!

Yeah, 1289 & 1291 are the same except the first is based on develop and the second on master. We could also just close 1289 and merge master into develop, and I think the effect would be the same.

### C-PAC on Habanero
<table class="conversation"><tr><td>Lisa</td><td markdown="1">
Apologies for dropping the ball on this, I was about to do it last week only to find out haba was down for maintenance and then needed to come back to it. I do appreciate your work on our project immensely.

Again:

I ran some things on habanero/singularity yesterday using your 6/30/20 image.
1. The less motion-y PACCT kid only returned the sinker errors so that's great! (sub-265)
2. I ran the same on a test SB project subject with less motion- this is single band data, and got many out puts, with slighty different errors than above. (diff-proj-SB151)
3. however, the more motion-y PACCT kid, using the same image, still returned with many fewer outputs (sub-318)

We finally have the newest Docker version on our smaller/local server as well, so I will be running a test with that and our config file. I don't know how long that will take, but I'll let you know when I get any output or crashes!
