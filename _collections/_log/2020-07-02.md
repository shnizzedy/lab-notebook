### fix Docker issue in Python package
#### Problem
([:octocat:](https://github.com/shnizzedy/cpac-python-package/blob/3e877f59602c98c659cb132edbf0348cfc170851/src/cpac/backends/docker.py#L102-L105))
```Python
self._run = self.container.exec_run(
    command, stream=True, demux=True
)
return(self._run.output)
```
is returning an empty list.
