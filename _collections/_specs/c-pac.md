I'd like to shoot for Friday July 10th for 1.7 release- which means code locked by preferably Tuesday or Wednesday next week

[â€¦]

I would like it if we could try out some of each other's additions to start sanity checking:
* running CPAC via cpac-py
* running the longitudinal pipelines with some appropriate data
* running the ANTS prior-based segmentation

For cpac-py, I think it's only working for Singularity at the moment. I'm not sure what the bug is with Docker, but it's recent and should be small. I can prioritize fixing it.

For a longitudinal run, do you have data in mind, or do we need to find some?

For ANTS priors, same question, plus human / NHP / rat?

I believe ants-prior segmentation is mainly for NHP. kick off 3 subjects oxford site data. `/data3/cnl/monkey_benchmark/cpac_run/run_bash/run_monkey_ants_priors_seg_0701.sh`
