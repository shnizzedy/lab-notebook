Before I joined the team, Steve started a research training progression Google document For onboarding new team members and collaborators. I've been going through the document and taking notes as part of my own onboarding and to strengthen the document.

I'm spending two hours per day most Mondays and Wednesdays on this project.

I've been thinking MediaWiki could be a good place for adapting training progression notes for collaboration & access. [Neuroimaging Data Processing](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Neuroimaging_Data_Processing) could be beefed up, for example, and glossary items could go in Wiktionary and/or Wikipedia.

At first I was thinking of setting up our own MediaWiki somewhere like [Miraheze](https://miraheze.org/), but then I though if we don't focus on C-PAC too specifically, going to a place where there are already people would be more inclusive and collaborative. And the book format makes sense for the idea of a progression (or multiple progressions).

Steve is looking at the next refinement/condensation layer of this, if we could boil down the progression into specific skills or nuggets.

The resources that I've consumend and annotated, at least in part, are listed below. The resource I'm currently focused on is in **bold**.
